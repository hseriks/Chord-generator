This program solves a common problem for musicians and amateur producers; to come up with new catchy chord progressions. 

The initial version of the program will be limited to 45 different chord progressions, e.g D, G, A is one progression, but future versions should be extended to include even more variations. 

The program will be interactive, in the sence that the program will act like a teacher, and provide tekst and questions to the users, like: 

print ("Welcome to the CHORD GENERATOR!") 
print ()
print ("I am at your disposal, offering 45 different progressions in the key of C, D, F, G, A. ") 
print ()
print ("Here is your first random chord progression:")

D,G,A

The initial version will output 1 popular song that uses these exact chords, and let the user play the song directly via Spotify. 

If the user is NOT happy with the progression, the program outputs a new progression. This will be an ongoing loop until the user is happy and decides on a progression to work with.

--------------

"The future version will propose more songs for each chord progression, with play buttons via spotify"

"The future version will propose more suitable chords to the progression, e.g with D,G,A, the chords Em and F also works well"

"The future version will offer transposing of chords, e.g from a D,G,A to E,A,B"
